===================
variables and types
===================


* Python is completely object oriented
* No need to declare variable before using them or declare their type
* **Every variable** in Python is an **Object**

* Numbers
    * Python Support 2 type of numbers Integer and Floating point number
    * To define an Integer use x = 7
    * To define a floating point number use x = 7.0
* Object Types
    * Python automatically assign object type based on the assignment 
    * For example ::

        >> x = 7
        >> type(x)
        <type 'int'>
        
        >> x = 'abc'
        >> type(x)
        <type 'str'>

        >> x = 7.7
        >> type(x)
        <type 'float'>
