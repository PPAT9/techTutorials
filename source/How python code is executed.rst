===========================
How python code is executed
===========================

At the command line::

    a = "helloâ€œ

There are four steps that python takes when you hit return lexing, parsing, compiling, and interpreting

1. **Lexing** is breaking the line of code you just typed into **tokens**
|
2. The **parser** takes those **tokens** and generates a structure that shows their relationship to each other (in this case, an **Abstract SyntaxTree**).
|
3. The **compiler** then takes the **AST** and turns it into one (or more) **code objects**. (function objects, code objects, and bytecode)
|
4. Finally, the **interpreter** takes each code object (It contains information that this interpreter needs to do its job) executes the code it represents
